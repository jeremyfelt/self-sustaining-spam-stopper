Today, I went to the beach with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my 4 year old daughter
and said “You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.” She put the shell to
her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched
her ear. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is totally off topic but I had to tell someone!
